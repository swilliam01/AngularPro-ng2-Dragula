Overview
The dragula library helps to create drag and drop functionality 
To install the library, use the command: "npm install ng2-dragula"

# Implementation
•	There's a dragula directive that makes a container's direct children draggable. You must supply a string. Both syntaxes, dragula="VAMPIRES" or [dragula]="'VAMPIRES'", work equally well.
•	You can group containers together by giving them the same group name. When you do, the children of each container can be dragged to any container in the same group.
•	Dragula Service can be used which exposes a few different methods with which you can interact with dragula.

# Usage

•	There is a button ‘Admin Portal’ when you go to create form after clicking ‘MEF’.
•	Admin portal will show you layout of JSON and you drag and drop to make changes and Save them.
•	The form will show you updated JSON upon saved.
